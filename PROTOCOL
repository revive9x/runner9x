Server starts listening.
Win9X client connects.


SERVER	   |       CLIENT
	   | <- HELLO
ACK ->	   |


The client is now listening for commands from the server.

RUN {FILE_SIZE}:

SERVER	      |       CLIENT
RUN (bytes) ->|
	      | <- ACK / NACK
	      
9X client accepts the request:
- kill the previous process
- write the file to executable to the %TEMP% directory
- execute the new program

SERVER	      |       CLIENT
SUBKILL    -> |
              | <- ACK / NACK
